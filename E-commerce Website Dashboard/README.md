I have created an Interactive dashboard for sales data of different E-commerce websites considering following parameters in Excel.

   1) Month of sales
   2) Gender based sales
   3) Category and types of clothes
   4) Different e-commerce websites
   5) State wise sales - Top 5 states
   6) Status of order i.e delivered, cancelled, refunded, returned.
